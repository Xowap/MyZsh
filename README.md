MyZsh
=====

This is my ninja ZSH config that's been following me for years. I'm just sick of copying it each time I install a new
computer, so I decided to host it publicly so I can find it back easily.

A few things were dev from me, most of it was stolen from the [formation Debian](http://formation-debian.via.ecp.fr/),
and the git abilities are basically adaptations from [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).
